LibXML-Raw-Gen-raku
===================

An attempt at generating LibXML Raw bindings for Raku.

This repository contains some artifacts left-over from initial
development of the LibXML Raku module. Stuff was cut-and-paste, but this generated files have not been used directly.

Could be useful for general hacking, but some work is needed to get the sources compiling and packaged as a stand-alone module.
